Innovating for minimally invasive care
It's the passion that drives us at Intuitive
Focused on what matters most
Intuitive, maker of the da Vinci surgical system and Ion endoluminal system, was founded with a simple belief: Medical intervention should help people recover as quickly and completely as possible. For 25 years, Intuitive has sought to deeply understand the needs of healthcare providers to fuel innovations that can help enable better outcomes. And, with seven million procedures performed by tens of thousands of surgeons worldwide, we’re more passionate than ever about innovating for minimally invasive care.
Surgeon and a da Vinci surgical system in the operating room
Designed to enhance surgeon capabilities
The da Vinci surgical system was one of the first robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgical systems cleared by the FDA. Today, a family of da Vinci systems and technologies is used by surgeons in all 50 U.S. states and 67 countries around the world.
Da Vinci SP system boom with led display
The next era of surgical innovation
For narrow access urologic surgery, the da Vinci SP system enables surgeons to operate through one incision. Designed to complement the da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi systems, the da Vinci SP provides surgeons with a familiar user experience for single port access.
Manufacturing engineer working on robotic arm prototype
Make an impact with your work
We're a mission-driven team and it’s the dedication to our work that inspires us to take on some of the biggest and most complex healthcare challenges. It’s also what draws some of the best talent in the industry to our global doorstep.
News highlights
Intuitive’s commitment to corporate sustainability
See how we’re working to create sustainable value for patients, physicians, hospitals, payers, employees, and shareholders in our 2019 report.
Gary Guthart in Investor’s Business Daily
Investor’s Business Daily asked CEO Gary Guthart about his journey to Intuitive and the development of robotic-assisted surgery.
Clearance for SynchroSeal and E-100 generator
The U.S. FDA has cleared SynchroSeal and E-100 generator for da Vinci X and Xi surgical systems, used in procedures that require sealing.
Making a difference in outcomes, “It’s our DNA”
CEO Gary Guthart talks with Mass Device about robotic-assisted surgery and the company’s five pillars for R&D investment.
Inguinal hernia study cites benefits of RAS
Published in Hernia: The World Journal of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery, a new study shows RAS benefits for inguinal hernia repair.
The science behind evidence-based care
Learn about the fast-accumulating clinical evidence that backs the advance of minimally invasive care.
Disclosures and Important Safety Information
Patients should talk to their doctor to decide if da Vinci surgery is right for them. Patients and doctors should review all available information on non-surgical and surgical options and associated risks in order to make an informed decision.
Serious complications may occur in any surgery, including da Vinci surgery, up to and including death. Serious risks include, but are not limited to, injury to tissues and organs and conversion to other surgical techniques which could result in a longer operative time and/or increased complications. For Important Safety Information, including surgical risks, indications, and considerations and contraindications for use, please also refer to www.intuitive.com/safety.
Individuals' outcomes may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to patient characteristics, disease characteristics and/or surgeon experience.

SmartRecruiters
The traditional Applicant Tracking System (or ATS), lacks hiring manager engagement, hiring team collaboration, and real integration with recruiting services.
As Liz Ryan wrote on Forbes, 'The ATS vendors that will survive to 2020 and beyond will be the ones that figure out how to humanize the selection process. Luckily, it isn't complicated.'
SmartRecruiters Talent Acquisition Suite is recruiting software that puts all your recruiting solutions, people, and vendors at your finger tips. This enables you to run your talent acquisition program like a high-powered marketing and sales machine.
Learn how the SmartRecruiters Talent Acquisition Suite can replace your legacy applicant tracking system and recruiting software.
